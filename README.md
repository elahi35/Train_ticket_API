# Train_ticket_API
The project's goal is to create a RESTful API for controlling the purchase of train tickets and associated features for a trip from London to France. It is made up of different parts arranged into packages. The TrainTicketsRestAPIApplication.java class initialises the application context and acts as the Spring Boot application's entry point.
